The Pocala device has four system buttons arranged vertically. The top button is used to increase the volume. Directly below it is the second button, which is used to decrease the volume. The third button is used when the user wants to speak: simply press this button to start recording, then release the button when finished speaking so that the system can process the recording. Finally, the bottom button is the reset button. Pressing this button will restart the entire program as if the Pocala device were being turned on for the first time. The reset button is also useful if there is a processing error in one of the modes, or if the user wants to quickly return to the main screen
