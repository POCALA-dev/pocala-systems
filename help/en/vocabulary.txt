Vocabulary Mode is used to expand your English vocabulary. After selecting this mode, you will be asked to specify the input language first, whether Indonesian or English.

Once the language is selected, you can immediately say a word in the input language. Pocala will then provide the results, including the translation, pronunciation or phonetics, definition of the word, and examples of its use in sentences.

Once the results are displayed, the system will ask if you want to try another word. If you answer yes, you can enter a new word. If you answer no, you will return to the mode selection menu.
