Grammar is a function in Assistant mode that is used to check the grammar in English sentences. After selecting Assistant mode, you can select the Grammar function to start using it.

Within this function, you can speak the English sentence you wish to check. Pocala will provide results in the form of sentence structure corrections if errors are detected, along with a brief explanation of the error's location. After the results are displayed, the system will ask if you wish to try another sentence. If you answer yes, you can provide a new sentence, and if you answer no, you will return to the function selection menu in Assistant mode.
