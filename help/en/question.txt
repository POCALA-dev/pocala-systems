Question is a function in Assistant mode that is used to request questions based on the desired topic and type. To use it, select Assistant mode and then select the Question function. Once you enter, you will be asked whether you want to select a specific topic or not. If you select yes, you can specify the topic as you wish, while if you select no, Pocala will automatically provide a random topic.

After that, you will be asked to choose the question type: multiple choice, short answer, or select a topic again. If you choose multiple choice or short answer, Pocala will create questions in English based on the topic and question type you selected. If you choose to select a topic again, you will be directed back to the topic selection stage.

After the question is displayed, you can provide your answer according to the instructions. Pocala will then evaluate and provide feedback on your answers. After the evaluation, the system will ask if you want to continue with a new question, change the topic, change the question type, change both, or stop. If you choose to continue, you will immediately receive a new question. If you change the topic or question type, you can adjust it as needed, while if not, you will return to the function selection menu in Assistant mode.
