The online version can only be used if the device is connected to the internet. After logging in, Pocala will ask you which mode you want to select: Vocabulary, Translator, or Assistant.

Once a mode is selected, you will be directed to it and can use it as needed. After finishing, Pocala will ask if you wish to remain in the online version. If you answer yes, you can continue with another mode. If you answer no, you will be returned to the home screen.
